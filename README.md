## Description

Day Master is a simple yet powerful tool for tracking and maintaining habits. It allows users to add their own tasks and monitor their completion on a daily basis. For each day a user completes all scheduled tasks, they earn 10 points.

The application relies on local storage for convenience and user privacy. However, in the future, we plan to implement cloud-based solutions to enable habit synchronization across different devices.

We also have plans to enhance the functionality by adding more achievements and interesting ways to earn them, providing an additional motivation for habit maintenance. Additionally, we intend to introduce progress analysis to provide users with valuable insights and information about their habits.

Day Master is the perfect tool for those looking to make positive changes in their lives through consistent habit keeping.
